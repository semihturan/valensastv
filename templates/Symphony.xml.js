        <description class="justified" allowsZooming="true">In 2015, Valensas Technology has developed Roche DIA Symphony application for Roche DIA. The application gives information about RACI categories of DIA division. Moreover, the app pro- vides a Learning Map, Frequently Asked Questions, a Glossary, documents of Divisional Stan- dards. Application is optimized for iOS 8, and iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. iOS 7 and older devices (iPhone 4 and higher, and iPad 2 and higher) are also supported. Since DIA Symphony application is similar to the previously built Pharma Symphony app, it was developed for testing in just under two weeks.</description>
